BASIA Peer Coaching Cohort 2
Giving and Receiving Feedback
>>
Good afternoon or good morning everyone, 
Thank you all for being here today. 
My name is [Your Name] and I am a data scientist at xxx. I work closely with different functional teams to analyze data and provide insights to drive business decisions. Through my experience, I have come to realize the immense benefits of giving and receiving feedback in the workplace. 
When we give feedback, we share our knowledge and experience with others, which can increase efficiency and engagement among team members. On the other hand, when we receive feedback, we have an opportunity to change our mindset and leverage the strengths of others instead of working in silos. 
Today, we are here to renew our commitment to the purpose of feedback and to increase our confidence and courage in giving and receiving feedback that is most impactful and actionable to us and to our business. In other words... we are going to learn and chat! And hope we will practice more after the session.  
So, let's get started with the BASIA Peer Coaching Cohort 2 on Giving and Receiving Feedback. As in an open discussion format, please feel free to chime in with your thoughts. 
Slide #2:
Objectives:
Understand the importance of quality feedback
Share knowledge on how to provide quality feedback
Develop strategies for receiving feedback effectively
>>
Today's session is focused on the importance of quality feedback and how we can provide and receive it effectively. Our objectives for this session are to:
- Understand the importance of quality feedback
- Share knowledge on how to provide quality feedback
- Develop strategies for receiving feedback effectively
Feedback is a critical component of any relationship and plays an important role in individual learning and growth. It helps to improve processes, and individuals can become more self-aware and socially aware through feedback. This aligns with Bayer LIFE values and is fitting for the attributes of Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility, and Efficiency.
Giving feedback can be challenging, especially when you have something critical to say. I have experienced multiple situations where I hesitate to say something or just let it store up or slide. Receiving feedback also comes with a growth mindset.
So, in this session, let's have an open discussion on the importance of quality feedback and share our experiences. We will discuss developing strategies for giving and receiving feedback effectively, which hopefully will help us to grow both personally and professionally. 
let's get started with our discussion.

Slide #3:
"How often do you give and/or receive feedback with your contact or colleague including your manager, peers, advisor, etc.?"
Yearly
Quarterly
Monthly
Weekly
Rarely
>>
Before we start, I would appreciate having your input for a quick question. The purpose of this survey question is to understand how frequently feedback is being exchanged among colleagues and collaborators, including managers or any Bayer colleagues. They can be a Contact-a colleague, or relative through whom you can gain access to information, favors, influential people. 
The question is, "How often do you give and/or receive feedback from your collaborators and other colleagues?" You will have five options to choose from:
- Yearly
- Quarterly
- Monthly
- Weekly
- Rarely
Please take a moment to think about your experience with giving and/or receiving feedback in the workplace and choose the option that reflects your situation. Your response will help us to better understand the frequency of giving/receiving feedback.
Thank you for your input, and let's move on to the next slide.
Slide #4:
Recognize that feedback is a gift for both giver and receiver
Tips for Givers:
Be thoughtful and pick the right "gift" for the receiver
Choose the right place and time to give feedback
Tips for Receivers:
Recognize that feedback is given with good intentions
Be thankful for it

Definition of Feedback:
Information about reactions to a person's performance of a task, etc. which is used as a basis for improvement.

>>
Feedback is a critical component of Bayer's culture, and it's encouraged in all directions - from leaders to employees, between employees, and from employees to leaders.
Feedback is the information that is used as a basis for improvement. Therefore, it can be recognized as a gift for both the giver and receiver. When we ground ourselves in our values, it's easy to see how important it is that we engage openly in feedback dialogues - both providing and requesting this gift often. It's the foundation of Bayer culture.
For the giver, we want the gift to be observed, impressed, and well taken by the receiver. So, picking the right content, right time, and right place is important for giving feedback to the receiver. Be prepared - use a structure to plan what you want to say, and provide the feedback as close to the event as possible. We always want to present a nice birthday gift at a friend's birthday party.
For the receiver, it's essential to assume good intent and be aware of emotional reactions. Maintain a non-defensive tone and body language and try to remain open to the feedback. Also, recognize that this is information that can provide you with new insights or understandings about how you or your behaviors are perceived by others. It's like a hand-knitted scarf that someone made for you. It might be oversize and not be the most fashionable accessory that you were hoping for, but it's filled with sincere and well-meant intentions, so the best you can do is to try it on.
Lastly, always take the time to thank the person giving you feedback, whether you agree with the feedback or not. Remember that giving feedback takes courage, so be sure to acknowledge the giver's courage and thank them.
Slide #5:
Importance of Feedback:
Brainstorm reasons why someone may be reluctant to give feedback
Identify areas where feedback can help individuals accomplish something or improve their overall experience
Discuss details that would make a feedback session effective

Now, we will be discussing the importance of feedback and how it can help individuals accomplish something or improve their overall experience. We will also brainstorm reasons why someone may be reluctant to give feedback and discuss details that would make a feedback session effective.
Feedback is critical to personal and professional growth. It helps individuals understand their strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for improvement, and achieve their goals. However, despite its importance, some people may be reluctant to give feedback for various reasons.
Let's take a moment to brainstorm some reasons why someone may be hesitant to give feedback. Some common reasons may include fear of hurting someone's feelings, fear of retaliation, lack of confidence in their ability to give feedback, or simply not knowing how to give feedback effectively.
Here are some reasons why someone may be reluctant to give feedback:
1. **Fear of negative impact**: Some individuals may believe that feedback is negative and unhelpful¹⁴. They might worry that the receiver will not like them¹⁴ or think that the receiver can't handle their feedback¹. They may also have experienced situations where the receiver didn't act upon their feedback, leading to reluctance in providing it again⁴.
2. **Relationship concerns**: People might avoid giving feedback because they fear it will hurt the relationship⁶. They may worry about damaging an existing relationship with the employee or how the employee may respond³.
3. **Lack of training**: Some managers might lack confidence in giving feedback due to a lack of training or experience⁵.
These are just a few examples, and there could be other reasons as well. It's important to create a safe and supportive environment that encourages open and constructive feedback.
__
Now that we have identified some potential barriers to giving feedback, let's focus on the benefits of feedback. Feedback can help individuals accomplish something by providing them with insights into their performance and behavior. It can also help them improve their overall experience by identifying areas where they can grow and develop.
Feedback is a valuable tool that can help individuals accomplish something or improve their overall experience in various areas. Here are some common areas where feedback can be beneficial:
1. **Personal Growth**: Feedback can provide individuals with a clear sense of something they can do differently, help them identify destructive patterns, and enable them to grow in their roles¹.
2. **Performance Improvement**: Constructive feedback can help individuals double down on their strengths, create an easy-to-follow improvement plan, and enhance their overall performance¹.
3. **Decision Making**: Feedback allows individuals to make better-informed decisions by learning from mistakes and gaining insights from others¹.
4. **Communication**: Feedback helps build and maintain effective communication with others, fostering a positive and supportive work culture¹.
5. **Goal Achievement**: By receiving feedback, individuals can identify areas of improvement and work towards reaching their goals¹.
6. **Career Development**: Feedback plays a crucial role in professional growth by providing insights into performance indicators and encouraging individuals to adapt to change or take on new job duties⁵.
7. **Team Collaboration**: Feedback in a team setting can provide direction, encourage goal completion, and motivate team members to perform better⁵.

Remember, feedback should be constructive, specific, and aimed at helping individuals improve⁵. It is a two-way street that benefits both the giver and the receiver.

Please note that these are general areas where feedback can be helpful. The specific areas may vary depending on the context and individual needs.
--
To make a feedback session effective, it's essential to establish trust between the giver and receiver. The giver should be clear about their intentions and provide specific examples to support their feedback. The receiver should be open to receiving feedback and ask clarifying questions to ensure they understand the feedback.

An effective feedback session can be a valuable tool for personal and professional growth. Here are some details that can make a feedback session more effective:
1. **Clear Objectives**: Clearly define the purpose of the feedback session. Establish specific goals and expectations to ensure that both the giver and receiver are on the same page.
2. **Constructive Approach**: Feedback should be constructive, focusing on areas for improvement rather than personal attacks. Use specific examples and provide actionable suggestions to help the receiver grow.
3. **Timeliness**: Provide feedback in a timely manner to ensure that it is relevant and actionable. Delayed feedback may lose its impact or relevance.
4. **Active Listening**: Both the giver and receiver should actively listen to each other during the feedback session. Encourage open dialogue, ask clarifying questions, and show genuine interest in understanding each other's perspectives.
5. **Two-Way Communication**: Feedback should be a two-way conversation, allowing both parties to express their thoughts and concerns. Encourage the receiver to ask questions, seek clarification, and provide their own input.
6. **Specificity**: Be specific when providing feedback. Avoid generalizations and provide concrete examples to illustrate your points. This helps the receiver understand exactly what they need to work on.
7. **Balance**: Provide a balanced perspective by highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. Recognize the receiver's achievements while also offering suggestions for growth.
8. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Feedback sessions should be conducted in a private and confidential setting to create a safe space for open and honest communication.
9. **Follow-Up**: After the feedback session, follow up with the receiver to check their progress, offer additional support if needed, and acknowledge their efforts.
10. **Continuous Improvement**: Encourage a culture of continuous improvement by making feedback an ongoing process rather than a one-time event. Regularly revisit goals, provide updates, and celebrate milestones.

Remember, effective feedback is a collaborative effort that requires trust, respect, and open-mindedness from both parties involved.
---
In summary, feedback is a critical component of personal and professional growth. While there may be barriers to giving feedback, it's essential to identify areas where feedback can help individuals accomplish something or improve their overall experience. By establishing trust and providing specific examples, a feedback session can be effective in helping individuals achieve their goals.

Slide #6:
Giving Feedback
>>
Let’s move forward to discussing the art of giving feedback. As we learned earlier, feedback is a gift for both the giver and receiver, and it's essential for personal and professional growth. In the next few slides, we will explore the tips for giving feedback.
Slide #7:
Giving Effective Feedback:
Choose an appropriate time and place to give feedback
Don't store up feedback; provide it in a timely manner
Consider schedules when giving feedback
Avoid giving negative feedback in public
Be aware of your and their body language when giving feedback
Use video when giving virtual feedback
Be prepared with specific examples and questions to encourage a dialogue
Keep an open mind

Feedback is most effective when it includes these Key Strategies and the dos and don'ts of giving effective feedback. Giving feedback can be challenging, with the right approach, it can be a valuable tool for personal and professional growth.

Firstly, it's essential to choose an appropriate time and place to give feedback. Find a quiet space where you won't be interrupted and where the receiver feels comfortable. It's also important to provide feedback in a timely manner and avoid storing it up. Waiting too long to provide feedback can dilute its impact and make it less effective. 
When giving feedback, it's also important to consider schedules. Make sure the receiver is not too busy or stressed, as this can affect their ability to receive feedback effectively. Additionally, be thoughtful on receiver’s feeling, always avoid giving negative feedback in public, as this can be embarrassing and undermine trust. This is quite challenging for the parent when the kid was running without watching for the surroundings. 

Body language is another crucial element of giving feedback. Be aware of your own body language and the receiver's body language. Maintain an open and non-defensive posture, and encourage the receiver to do the same. If giving virtual feedback, consider using video to enhance communication.

To give effective feedback, it's important to be prepared with specific examples and questions that encourage dialogue. This will help the receiver understand the feedback and identify areas for improvement. Finally, keep an open mind when giving feedback. Feedback is a two-way street, so be receptive to the receiver's thoughts and ideas.

In summary, giving effective feedback requires careful consideration of time, place, and body language. Being prepared with specific examples and questions can also encourage dialogue and help the receiver understand the feedback. By keeping an open mind and avoiding negative feedback in public, we can create a culture of trust and growth.

Slide #8:
How to Deliver Feedback Effectively:

Eliminate the word "but" and use "and" instead
Example of But Feedback: You have [charismatic body language and presence] that brings your speech to life but your vocal variety is not that good. Huh?
Example of And Feedback: You have [charismatic body language and presence] that brings your speech to life and you could improve on those two elements by including vocal variety to draw your audience in more to your story.
Be specific and avoid vague feedback
Example of Vague Feedback: You need to be more expressive. Huh?
Example of Better Constructive Feedback: Body language and tone are two ways that will help you be more expressive in your speech.
Provide feedback within 3 days (or less) of the event, even if it is to say that you are still working on the investigation.

>>
How to deliver feedback effectively? We've already recognized that feedback is a gift for both the giver and receiver, and it's essential for personal and professional growth. Delivering feedback can still be challenging in the actual conversation, so let's explore some tips for delivering feedback effectively.
Firstly, eliminate the word "but" and use "and" instead. Using "but" can make the receiver feel defensive and negate the positive aspects of the feedback. For example, instead of saying "You have charismatic body language and presence and presence that brings your speech to life, but your vocal variety is not that good," You may think this is softening the blow, but your colleague might be thinking: "what's wrong now?". Try saying "You have charismatic body language and presence and presence that brings your speech to life, AND you could improve on those two elements by including vocal variety to draw your audience in more to your story."
Secondly, be specific and avoid vague feedback. Vague feedback can be confusing and unhelpful. For example, instead of saying "You need to be more expressive," try saying "Body language and tone are two ways that will help you be more expressive in your speech."
Lastly, provide feedback within three days (or less) of the event, even if it is to say that you are still working on the investigation. This will ensure that the feedback is timely and relevant.
It's also important to avoid using phrases like "I think you did a good job but..." as this can quickly make people become defensive. Instead, focus on specific examples and provide actionable feedback.
In summary, delivering feedback effectively requires eliminating the word "but," being specific, and providing timely feedback. By focusing on specific examples and actionable feedback, we can create a culture of growth and development.

Slide #9:
Four-part formula: 
(1)	Starting with a short but important question to signal the feedback 
(2)	Stating specific data points without using subjective words
(3)	Explaining the impact of the data on oneself, 
(4)	Ending with a question to encourage a collaborative problem-solving approach

>>
Only 26 percent of employees believe that the feedback they receive improves their work. Either people give feedback that is too indirect & soft. Or, they're too direct and make the other person feel threatened. Cognitive psychologist LeeAnn Renniger shares a scientifically proven method for giving effective feedback.
Giving effective feedback involves using a four-part formula: (1) starting with a short but important question to signal the feedback. A micro-yes question is used as a pacing tool to let the other person know that feedback is about to be given.. e.g. "Do you have a minute to talk about that last meeting takeaways?" (2) Specific data points should be used instead of blur words to create clarity. Say, "You said you'd give me the data by 1pm to review and I still don't have it." (3) Show Impact. The impact statement should explain how the data point impacted the person giving feedback. e.g. "Because I didn't receive the data, I was blocked on my analysis work." (4) Wrap your feedback with a question. Great feedback givers ask questions and seek feedback regularly.. e.g. “what do you think?”, "How do you see it?" "This is what I'm thinking. What are your thoughts?"
It is also important to actively seek feedback, establishing oneself as a continual learner.

Slide #10:
Receiving feedback
>>
We've already explored how to give feedback effectively, it's equally important to know how to receive feedback gracefully and constructively. In the next few slides, we will delve into strategies for receiving feedback and making the most out of it. So, let's dive in.
Slide #11:
Title: Receiving Feedback Effectively

Tips for Receiving Feedback:

Say "Thank you" or "Could you clarify on (x-point)," then say "Thank You"
Do not agree or disagree with the feedback, simply say "Thank you"
Take feedback seriously but not personally
Consider the information and use it to improve yourself, the situation, the process, the product, the service, etc.
Listen, respect, Ask, Appreciate, Reflect, Grow
>>
Receiving feedback can sometimes be challenging, with the right approach, it can be a valuable opportunity for growth and improvement. Let's explore some tips for receiving feedback effectively.
Firstly, when receiving feedback, it's important to respond with gratitude. Say "Thank you" or "Could you clarify on (x-point)," and then say "Thank you" again. This shows appreciation for the feedback and encourages further dialogue.
Next, it's crucial not to immediately agree or disagree with the feedback. Instead, simply say "Thank you" to acknowledge the feedback. This allows you to remain open-minded and receptive to feedback without becoming defensive.
Taking feedback seriously but not personally is another important aspect of receiving feedback effectively. Remember that feedback is about the situation, process, product, service, or your performance, and not a personal attack. By separating yourself from the feedback, you can objectively consider the information and use it to improve yourself and the situation.
Listening, respecting, asking questions, appreciating the feedback, reflecting on it, and using it as an opportunity to grow are key elements of effective feedback reception. Actively listen to understand the feedback, respect the perspective of the giver, ask clarifying questions if needed, appreciate their input, reflect on how you can apply the feedback to improve, and use it as a catalyst for personal and professional growth.
In summary, receiving feedback effectively involves expressing gratitude, refraining from immediate agreement or disagreement, taking feedback seriously but not personally, and actively engaging in listening, respecting, asking questions, appreciating, reflecting, and growing.
Any comments and input for receiving feedback?

Slide #12:

Feedback can be seen as a source of fear or a catalyst for growth; the speaker encourages shifting from feedback to feed-forward, where feedback becomes a partnership rather than a trial; embracing feedback can lead to joy as it helps us see who we are becoming and creates opportunities for change.
•	Joe shares his fear of receiving feedback and how he avoided it for a long time.
•	Feedback can make us feel exposed, but it can also give rise to the joy of knowing we can do something different or become someone different.
•	Giving feedback like a mirror holder can change our whole view and help others see for themselves.
•	To make feedback a partnership, let go off window gazing and start doing more mirror holding.

>>
In this personal talk, speaker/author Joe Hirsch makes a passionate case for sharing "feedforward," a new view of human potential.

The speaker shares his fear of receiving feedback and how he avoided it for a long time.
- He was ashamed of his shortcomings and didn't want to discover how others saw him.
- He pulled back and avoided feedback by building walls and closing doors.

Feedback can make us feel exposed, but it can also give rise to the joy of knowing we can do something different or become someone different.
- Feed-forward is a change in our whole outlook and can push us forward towards a future of promise and potential.

Giving feedback like a mirror holder can change our whole view and help others see for themselves.
- Feedback from a window gazer is just one view that matters, but feed-forward as a mirror holder provides a whole other perspective.
- The difference between giving feedback like a window gazer or a mirror holder could be the difference between having power or a partner, and fear or joy.

To make feedback a partnership, let go of window gazing and start doing more mirror holding.
- Feedback should be a partnership, not a trial.
- Getting feedback should involve finding mirror holders to help improve your view.
- Making the shift from feedback to feed-forward helps us see where we're headed, not just where we've been.

Feedback Giver:
- Community trustee
- Stopped by my house in person at the right time and place
- Used his own experience as an example to encourage dialogue
- Compared the pros and cons for each option to keep an open mind
Feedback Receiver (Me):
- Listened carefully and considered the information
- Respected his visit
- Asked questions about different choices
- Was thankful for the feedback
Outcome:
- Installed new vinyl siding for the entire exterior of the house
- Achieved good quality while saving money
